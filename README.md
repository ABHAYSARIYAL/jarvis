## 📖 **Project Overview**
Vision is a voice-controlled AI assistant that can automate tasks like opening apps, searching online, playing YouTube videos, sending WhatsApp messages, checking the weather, and more. The assistant listens for voice commands, recognizes them using speech recognition, and performs actions accordingly.

---

## ✨ **Features**
- **Voice Interaction:** Vision responds to user voice commands.
- **App Control:** Open common desktop applications like Notepad, Calculator, VS Code, and Discord.
- **Online Search:** Search Google, Wikipedia, and YouTube directly from voice commands.
- **Email & Messaging:** Send emails and WhatsApp messages.
- **Weather Reports:** Get real-time weather information.
- **News Updates:** Stay updated with the latest news by category.
- **Fun Features:** Get jokes, advice, and more.

---

## 🛠️ **Technologies Used**
- **Language:** Python
- **Libraries:**
  - `speech_recognition`: To recognize and convert user speech to text.
  - `pyttsx3`: Text-to-speech conversion.
  - `requests`: API requests for news, weather, etc.
  - `decouple`: For environment variable management.
  - `pprint`: Pretty print output for readability.

## 📦 **Installation**

### Prerequisites
- **Python 3.8+**
- **pip** (Python package installer)

### Step-by-Step Installation
1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ABHAYSARIYAL/jarvis.git
   cd jarvis
   ```

2. **Create a Virtual Environment**:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\\Scripts\\activate`
   ```

3. **Install Required Packages**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Set Up Environment Variables**:
   Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following content:
   ```bash
   USER=YourName
   BOTNAME=Vision
   NEWS_API_KEY=your_news_api_key
   OPENWEATHER_APP_ID=your_openweather_api_key
   EMAIL=your_email@example.com
   PASSWORD=your_email_password
   ```

---

## ⚙️ **Configuration**
- **API Keys:** You will need API keys for [OpenWeather](https://openweathermap.org/api) and [News API](https://newsapi.org/).
- **Email Credentials:** For sending emails, you may need to enable "Less Secure Apps" access in your email provider.

---

## 🚀 **How to Run**
1. **Activate the Virtual Environment**:
   ```bash
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\\Scripts\\activate`
   ```

2. **Run the Application**:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

---

## 💻 **Usage**
Here are some of the commands you can give to Vision:
- **System Control:** "Open Notepad", "Open Calculator", "Open Discord", "Open VS Code"
- **Online Search:** "Search on Google", "Search on Wikipedia", "Play on YouTube"
- **Messaging:** "Send WhatsApp message", "Send an email"
- **Weather & News:** "What's the weather?", "Show me the latest tech news"
- **Fun Commands:** "Tell me a joke", "Give me some advice"

---

## 📁 **File Descriptions**

- **`.env`**: Contains sensitive API keys and email credentials.
- **`main.py`**: The main script that handles user input, triggers actions, and manages the assistant's logic.
- **`utils.py`**: Utility file containing helper functions for text-to-speech and random opening text responses.
- **`functions/`**: This folder contains all the specific modules for operations like sending emails, controlling apps, and fetching online data.
- **`PyWhatKit_DB.txt`**: Stores logs of WhatsApp messages sent.

## 📅 **Full Roadmap to Build Vision AI Assistant**

### **Phase 1: Setup & Preparation**
1. **Install Python and IDE (VS Code or PyCharm).**
2. **Set up GitHub repository** to track code and manage version control.
3. **Install essential libraries** (`speech_recognition`, `pyttsx3`, `requests`, `decouple`, etc.).

---

### **Phase 2: Core Functionalities**
1. **Voice Input:**
   - Use `speech_recognition` to capture and recognize voice commands.
   
2. **Text-to-Speech:**
   - Implement `pyttsx3` to enable the assistant to respond with voice.
   
3. **Greeting System:**
   - Greet users based on the time of the day (Good Morning, Good Afternoon, etc.).
   
4. **Command Handling:**
   - Implement logic to identify the user's commands (like open apps, check weather, etc.).
   
5. **App Control:**
   - Open applications like Notepad, Calculator, VS Code, and Discord.

---

### **Phase 3: Advanced Features**
1. **Google, Wikipedia, and YouTube Search:**
   - Add commands for online search and YouTube video playback.
   
2. **Email System:**
   - Use SMTP to send emails from the assistant.
   
3. **WhatsApp Integration:**
   - Integrate with PyWhatKit to send WhatsApp messages.
   
4. **Weather & News:**
   - Use OpenWeather and News API to display current weather and news headlines.

---

### **Phase 4: Error Handling & Testing**
1. **Handle Errors:**
   - Add try-except blocks for network issues and invalid API keys.
   
2. **Test All Functions:**
   - Test each function independently (voice, weather, news, app control, etc.).

---

### **Phase 5: Deployment**
1. **Create a Requirements File** (`pip freeze > requirements.txt`).
2. **Push to GitHub** and share with contributors.
3. **Create a Detailed README** (already done).
4. **Optional:** Package as an executable file using PyInstaller.
